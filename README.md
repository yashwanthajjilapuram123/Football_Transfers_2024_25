# Football Transfer Market Analysis – 2024/25 Season

This project analyzes global football transfers from the 2024/25 summer and winter windows using data scraped from Transfermarkt. The goal was to uncover **value inefficiencies**, **club transfer behavior**, and **position-specific spending trends**—with a focus on delivering insights relevant to **scouting, recruitment, and data-driven club strategy**.
